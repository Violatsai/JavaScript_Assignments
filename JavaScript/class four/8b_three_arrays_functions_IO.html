    <!-- Yeah, remember, you have to DEFINE something before you manipulate it...
            and with HTML, steps are performed in the order they appear in the script,
            so getting an element by ID before you've defined what that element is
            is like asking to deliver a letter, but dropping it on the floor before saying the address -->
